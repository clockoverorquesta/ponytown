i get really nervous whenever im talking to someone i find cool so if you interact with me i'm so so sorry for my awkwardness,, also for my lag
<p align="center">
there's like a 50% chance im offtab when you see me,, if you really want to say something to me whispering would be a good option

cuddles and hugs/hide are a-okay at all times if you do i will be so happy... and awkward because i am so happy
